/*
 Given a non negative integer number num. For every numbers i in the range 0 <= i <= num calculate the number of 1's in
 their binary representation and return them as an array.

 Example:
 For num = 5 you should return [0,1,1,2,1,2].

 Follow up:
 Space complexity should be O(n).
 Hint:

 You should make use of what you have produced already.
 Divide the numbers in ranges like [2-3], [4-7], [8-15] and so on. And try to generate new range from previous.
 Or does the odd/even status of the number help you in calculating the number of 1s?
